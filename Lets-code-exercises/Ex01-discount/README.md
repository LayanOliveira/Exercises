# Day 01: Discount Exercise

A store has a discount policy according to the customer's purchase amount. Discounts start above US$ 500. For every `100` dolars over `US$ 500` the customer gets a `1%` discount up to `25%`.

**For exemple:** US$ 500 = 1% || US$ 600 = 2% ... etc...

Write a program that displays this table of discounts in the following format: 

#### Purchase Value - Discount Percentage - Final Value

    US$: 500               1              US$: 495  
    US$: 600               2              US$: 588  
    US$: 700               3              US$: 679
